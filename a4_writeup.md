# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
The most difficult part was understanding why I had to put a option for each move in the game, such as writing lines for each move made. It was also difficult matching the numbers and the spaces, as I continuously mixed them up.
2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
You could add a computer that has to be coded to know how to play, and would code it to make a move after I have moved.
3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
I would make a database based on every possible move for each turn and have it give you the best move in that situation so the computer could read through each time and make the best possible move.
